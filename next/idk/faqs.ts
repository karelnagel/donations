      answer:
        "Collections can have many projects, because each collection requires deploying a new smart contract, which is expensive. If one streamer want's to start raising for some other cause or for other account we recommend starting a new project.

      question: "Are there any commissions?",
      answer: "No! Everything goes to the creator, but the supporters will still have to pay the gas fee, which depends on the network",

      question: "Is it decentralized?",
      answer:
        "All the smart contracts are deployed and can't be changed, all the tokens metadata still comes from private server but we are working on moving it to IPFS to make it more decentralized. Also we might launch a DAO to make the project community owned",
