  { question: "How to start?", answer: "Go to https://streamint.xyz/new and start your first collection and project" },

  {
    question: "Which networks Streamint supports?",
    answer: "We are currently only on Polygon, but could possibly go to other chains as well if there is demand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any commissions?",
    answer: "There are no commissions, all the money goes to the streamer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which coins it supports?",
    answer: "It supports every ERC20 coin, but the user interface only has the largest coins right now. If you have a coin that isn't present then hmu.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a collection?",
    answer: "Collection is a new ERC721 smart contract that gets deployed to the network when you start. Collection appears in Opensea as a collection and they can have multiple projects with different beneficiaries, goals, coins and causes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a project?",
    answer: "When creating a collection then it will automatically create first project, but you can create other projects afterwards. Each project can have it's own beneficiary, goal, coin etc. Projects are a good way to not create a new collection every time you want to change beneficiary, collect different coin, or collect for a diffferent cause.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens with the NFT after donating?",
    answer: "It is up to the streamer to decide what they want to do with the NFTs. They could have like private groups, or events to all the NFT holders or they could do an airdrop or anything else they wish. Every NFT has info about the donation, like amount donated, donator, project id and donation message, so 10 x 1 DAI donation could be treated the same way as one 10 DAI donation."
