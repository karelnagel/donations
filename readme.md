# Ethereum donations

This dapp is for accepting crypto donations regulary or by adding them into your live stream. It works with any ERC20 coin, but right now front-end is limited to 5 coins, you could still use your custom coin when creating project in Etherscan, but I also can add coins on demand. All the data is stored on chain or on IPFS. No commissions. Currently deployed only on Polygon Matic network.

## Streaming

## NFTs

After each donation user gets a NFT that shows that they have donated to that project. This allows the creator to connect with their supporters, create events only for supporters and give back to their early supporters. On the other hand supporters can use their NFTs to flex and show that they care about some cause.
